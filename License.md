## 1. Preamble

The ARKTIK Hybrid License governs the use, distribution, and contribution to ARKTIK Execution-as-a-Service (EaaS). This license ensures that execution-driven principles remain protected while allowing open access to those who align with ARKTIK’s faith-driven, results-based economy.

ARKTIK EaaS is not open-source in the conventional sense—it is execution-sourced. Those who execute gain access, ownership, and participation.
